The HeterogeneityCodes.RData provides all necessary codes for simulation studies for our paper "A multi-class likelihood ratio approach for genetic risk prediction allowing for phenotypic heterogeneity"

The function "SampleSim" in HeterogeneityCodes.RData samples individuals from the genearl population.
The function "getsample" in HeterogeneityCodes.RData reformats the data.
The function "CROSS" in HeterogeneityCodes.RData performs the MLR procedure to determine the optinum number of underlying sub-phenotype groups given 3 different weights.
The function "getalltestauc" in HeterogeneityCodes.RData outputs the way of combining sub-phenotype groups and the corresponding AUC.
The function "Forward_U" in HeterogeneityCodes.RData is a wrapper function to perform the forward selection algorithm. 

The "Example.r" provides a simple example of running the programs.
